<p id="about-info">
I am  a high school student from Delaware. I attend a school for performing and creative arts, where I major in Communication Arts. Photography is one of my main focus areas, and I think that like my major itself, photography is a very broad, diverse field, which is one of my favorite things about it. Over the past school year, Iâ€™ve gotten the chance to take photos that encompass a wide variety of subjects and themes, including portrait photography, motion photography, and street photography. I didn't anticipate being any good at photography, but capturing a a good image is one of my favorite things to do.

<p id="about-info-pt-2">
In addition to photography, I also enjoy writing, and I feel like I've been writing for my whole life. Writing is my favorite way to express myself, and there's nothing I love more than getting lost in the world of characters I've created. Like photography, writing is incredibly diverse, and can span many different genres. Over the past few years, I've written short stories, poems, essays, and even a screenplay for a a short film. Cultivating my craft and finding my voice over the past few years hasn't always been easy, but I can't wait to keep going.
